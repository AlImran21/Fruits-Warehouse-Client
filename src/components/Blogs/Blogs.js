                <p>Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, <br /> due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites <br /> and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, <br /> push-based architectures in mind.</p>

                <h3 className='mb-3'>Q2.2 When should you use mongodb?</h3>
                <p>NoSQL databases like MongoDB are a good choice when your data <br /> is document-centric and doesn't fit well into the schema of a relational <br /> database, when you need to accommodate massive scale, when <br /> you are rapidly prototyping, and a few other use cases.</p>

                <h3 className='mb-3'>Q4.1 What is the purpose of jwt?</h3>
                <p>JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share <br /> security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. <br /> Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. <br /> JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the <br /> claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.</p>

            <div className='container py-3'>
                <h3 className='mb-3'>Q4.2 How does it work?</h3>
                <p>JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. <br /> Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. <br /> What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, <br /> a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, <br /> or what permissions the client has been granted.
